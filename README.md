Instruction:
- The folder Algorithms contains all the neural network modules e.g. Optimizer, HiddenLayer...
- The folder Assignment-Dataset, contains the data
- The folder experiments contains all the ipynb files used to conduct the experiments, each notebook can be run by simply click run all in jupyter notebook, VS code or Google Colab. All experiments can be run independently.
- The folder preprocessing contain the ipynb file for exploratory data analysis. It can also be run just like a experiment.
- Visual_outputs folder contains all the image generated by the experiments.
